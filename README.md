# Evolution-DHT
A P2P DHT engine inspired by kademlia algorithm, written in c# completely from scratch using dotnet 4.0 framework and varius nuget packages.

Push start on your Visual Studio 2015 Community edition and it should run the DevConsole UI.
You should be able to use all the feature implemented at this time and be able to search and retrive keys in a distribuited manner between nodes of the DHT network.

THIS PROJECT IS UNMAINTAINED and looking for support.
Feel free to ask questions in the issues.
